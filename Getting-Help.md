For assistance with HackRF general use or development, please subscribe to the [HackRF-dev mailing list](http://nine.pairlist.net/mailman/listinfo/hackrf-dev).  This is the preferred way to share test results or ask questions.  Additionally, you may want to join the #hackrf IRC channel on [freenode](http://freenode.net/).  Specific bugs and feature requests may be added to the [Issues List](https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf/issues?direction=desc&sort=updated&state=open) though they should probably be discussed on the mailing list or IRC first.
