HackRF clock signals are generated by the Si5351.  The plan so far:

* crystal frequency: 25 MHz (supports 25 or 27 MHz)
* recommended clock input frequency: 10 MHz (supports 10 to 40 MHz, or higher with division)
* VCO frequency: 800 MHz (supports 600 to 900 MHz)
* MAX2837 clock: 40 MHz
* preferred MAX5864 clocks: 8, 10, 12.5, 16, 20 MHz
* LPC4330 clock: 20 MHz (from integer-only output)

A DDR clock at double the MAX5864 will be delivered to the CPLD.
