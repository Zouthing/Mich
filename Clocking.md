HackRF clock signals are generated by the Si5351.  The plan so far:

* crystal frequency: 25 MHz (supports 25 or 27 MHz)
* optional clock input frequency: 10 MHz recommended (supports 10 to 40 MHz, or higher with division)
* VCO frequency: 800 MHz (supports 600 to 900 MHz)
* MAX2837 clock: 40 MHz
* preferred MAX5864 clocks: 8, 10, 12.5, 20 MHz
* A clock at quadruple the MAX5864 rate will be delivered to the CPLD.
* LPC43xx clock: 12 MHz (from separate crystal so the ROM-based USB DFU will work)

Future Si5351 output mapping:

CLK0 -> none
CLK1 -> none
CLK2 -> RFFC5071
CLK3 -> MAX2837
CLK4 -> MAX5864
CLK5 -> external clock output
CLK6 -> CPLD
CLK7 -> CPLD
